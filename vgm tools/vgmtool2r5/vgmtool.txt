VGMTool 2
=========

Release 5

A tool for editing VGM files.

It can:

- edit the VGM header
- edit, add and remove the GD3 tag
- trim data (for some chips) and insert state-restoring data to allow sample-
  accurate editing of tracks, and loop definition
- optimise data by removing data that does not affect the system state
- check VGM files are valid
- output VGM data in a human-readable format
- remove selected chips' channels' data from the file
- convert GYM, CYM and SSL files to the VGM format
- compress and decompress VGM files
- and more.

Quick instructions
==================

Run the program, and drag-and-drop a file onto it. If it's a valid VGM (or VGZ)
file it'll be loaded.

Use the buttons to do what you want. For basic usage, just use the Trimming box
(enter the trimming points (in samples) and click on Trim) and GD3 tag box
(enter text and click on Update GD3).

If you are entering a playback rate, set the version number to 1.01 or later;
lower numbers may cause players to ignore it.

If you are entering YM2612 or YM2151 clock speeds, or PSG feedback/shift register 
size parameters, set the version number to 1.10 or later; lower values may cause
them to be ignored. In particular, the YM2413 clock will be used instead of the
YM2612 and YM2151 clocks.

Please be careful with version numbers, and check that your files work after any
editing.



History
=======

30/10/05  VGM 1.10 updates, and various work on the trimmer which is currently
          hidden - the trimmer is the same as r4.
          Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtool/ to see the source
          code and maybe help develop VGMTool.
11/2/05   More refactoring; Finally managed to manually add Ctrl+Tab/
          Shift+Ctrl+Tab support to the tab control! MS don't make that easy.
		  Added a commandline parser.
8/2/05    Restarted refactoring process; Esc no longer closes the window
8/6/04    Re-added tab images and trimming logging
7/6/04    Made NCR recognition always happen so tagging can be done more easily
          in Windows XP
2002-2003 Various efforts on the trimming engine, and many little tweaks, some
          of which was lost in a disk crash
4/6/02    Rewrote trimmer to be more accurate
2/6/02    Added GYMX (YMAmp compression/tagging) detection and GYM DAC data
          conversion
1/6/02    Release 4
1/6/02    Added GYM (not GYMX), CYM and SSL conversion; fixed a bug in the
          optimiser
31/5/02   Redesigned GUI; added clock rate setting and title/lengths copying
28/5/02   Release 3
27/5/02   Added Unicode NCR conversion for GD3s, and made GD3 System a combobox
          which fills in the Japanese equivalent where possible
19/5/02   Fixed some bugs in the YM2413 optimiser
13/5/02   Added VGM rate detection button, and 50->60Hz conversion button
8/4/02    Public release 2
8/4/02    Improved PSG handling based on new information I found, lots of other
          bug fixes
4/3/02    Fixed a bug which made the GD3 tagger crash the program if no existing
          GD3 had been opened yet
3/3/02    Improved handling of YM2612 and YM2151 data (ie. stopped discarding
          it)
10/3/02   The GD3 updater was incorrectly setting the EOF offset, it's fixed.
30/1/02   Public release 1
30/12/01  Version (hmm) 7ish, I haven't been writing here for a while. Fixed a
          bug where when a tone key was lifted and pressed with the same
          settings, the second press was not written; fixed a bug where it
          would show a time like "0:60"; other stuff too no doubt
28/11/01  Version 5 - fixed a bug with the length display
27/11/01  Version 4 - fixed some bugs with PSG looping, and when FM keys were
          lifted and pressed instantaneously. Fixed a bug with the GD3 tagger.
23/11/01  Version 3 - added GD3 editor
22/11/01  Version 2 - changed to GUI
20/11/01  Version 1 - console mode


"Cannot convert compressed GYM"
===============================

The YM-Amp Winamp plugin for GYM and CYM files introduced a descriptive header
for GYM files. This was enhanced with GYM-tailored compression in an unofficial
update. Unfortunately, this compression is not documented so I can't decompress
it. (I suspect it's quite complicated anyway.)

So, if you want to convert such files, you need to decompress them. YM-Amp is a
bit buggy, you have to do it exactly like this:

1. Get YMAmp 2.0b plugin
2. Load GYM files in Winamp
3. Press Play (X)
4. Press Alt+3
5. Click "Decompress", "OK"
6. Press Next (B)
7. Go to 4

In other words, you have to only decompress the currently playing (or, the last
played) file.


Right-click -> VGMTool
======================

Maybe it's useful for you to be able to edit VGM files without having to open
VGMTool and drag/drop onto it. Simply open up Regedit and find

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.vgm

It should be there if you've got VGM files associated with Winamp.

Under that, add a key called "shell"; under that, add one called "Edit"; under
that, add one called "command". Under that (phew!) double-click on "(Default)"
and type in something like this:

"c:\Program Files\VGMTool\VGMTool.exe" "%1"

where you've written the path to VGMTool, enclosed in quotes, followed by a
space, then "%1" (including the quotes).

Do the same for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.vgz if you want.

Now, right-clicking on VGM files will give an Edit option. Change the (Default)
value of the "Edit" key to something else, like "Edit with &VGMTool", to
customise even more.


International characters
========================

VGMTool supports the Unicode text in GD3 tags. It does this in three ways:

1. If it can send the Unicode direct to the edit boxes, it will.
2. If it can't, it will try to convert to your system's native character set.
3. If that fails, it will convert any non-ASCII characters to HTML-style
   hexadecimal Numerical Character References.

This should allow text to be displayed without loss of information, and in the
most visible way possible. You should be able to edit the text and it will be
processed back to the tag's Unicode representation in a similar way.

If you want to see Japanese text properly, you have to install the requried
support on your system. In Windows XP, open the "Regional and Language Options"
control panel applet, choose the "Languages" tab and select "Install files for
East Asian languages". (Of course, if your Windows is not English, it'll be
labelled in your language.) You'll need the installation CD for the requires
hundreds of megabytes of files. That should be enough for you to see all the
GD3 text you're likely to ever see.

If you don't, you might see "boxes" in place of undisplayable characters.
Simply ignore them and they will not destroy any information.

Hexadecimal NCRs will always be processed, no matter what the conversion mode,
so you can always use them when needed. I don't deal with decimal NCRs at all,
and broken NCRs might cause problems.
